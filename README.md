# Some explorations of [Pixie](https://github.com/pixie-lang) and [Go](https://golang.org/)

Go is a great systems language...

Pixie is a great Clojuresque Lisp...

Building stuff for Docker-related projects means mostly using Go...

But it's nice to have Pixie's immutable data structures and the ability to
`eval` code...

So...

This project is an attempt to get both playing nicely together.
